# my-Codewars-Solutions

Aim of this repository is to upload solutions to challenges, called _Kata_, completed on _codewars.com_ using C# .

## Purpose

The objective behind completing katas is to improve my programming skills.
Every kata is ranked, and the ranking system works by going from _8 kyu_ to _1 kyu_. 8 is the simplest and 1 is the most complex.

## Naming convention

Each kata is contained inside it's own class, and each class is assigned to a kyu rank.
